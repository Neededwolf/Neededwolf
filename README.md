### Hi there...
### please read this :)
### this is just about me so it is not much

1. I play osu - https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30634715
2. I have been programming (at home) since 2020, all thanks to my computing teacher :)
3. I enjoy making random games and playing videogames with friends
   - I want to bring the making of games and playing games with friends together
     as I will know what other people would like and make a game like it
     or well I hope to
